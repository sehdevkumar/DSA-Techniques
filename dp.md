```js


function(problem, memo):
    // Base case: Check if the problem meets a stopping condition
    if base case of problem:
        return result for base case

    // Check if the result is already computed and stored in memo
    if problem is in memo:
        return memo[problem]

    // Recursive case: Divide the problem into subproblems
    result = 0  // Initialize result (can be modified based on the problem)

    for each subproblem in subproblems related to problem:
        result += solve(subproblem, memo)  // Combine results from subproblems

    memo[problem] = result  // Store the computed result in memo for future reference
    return result  // Return the computed result
```




### Easy Dynamic Programming Problems

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - **Description**: Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using the relation \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \).

2. **Climbing Stairs**
   - **Description**: Count the number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with \( n \) steps, where you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time.

3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**
   - **Description**: Find the length of the longest subsequence present in two sequences, such as strings.

4. **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)**
   - **Description**: Calculate the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to convert one string into another.

5. **Knapsack Problem (0/1 Knapsack)**
   - **Description**: Given weights and values of items, determine the maximum value you can carry in a knapsack of fixed capacity.

6. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**
   - **Description**: Find the length of the longest subsequence in an array where elements are in increasing order.

7. **Coin Change Problem**
   - **Description**: Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a specific amount using a given set of coin denominations.

8. **Subset Sum Problem**
   - **Description**: Given a set of integers, determine if there is a subset that adds up to a specific sum.

9. **Unique Paths**
   - **Description**: Count the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, moving only down or right.

10. **House Robber Problem**
    - **Description**: Maximize the amount of money you can rob from a row of houses without robbing two adjacent houses.

These problems are relatively straightforward and serve as great starting points for practicing dynamic programming concepts. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these problems or see their implementations?
